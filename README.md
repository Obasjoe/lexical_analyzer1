# A Simple Recursive-Descent Parser

This is a modified implementation of the parser in pp. 181 - 185 of the textbook

 Sebesta, R. W. (2012). Concepts of Programming Languages. 
 Pearson, 10th edition.

 This implementation follows a completely new set of rules than specified in the Textbook. I will continue to update this readme when i find 
 those rules.
